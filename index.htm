            <p class="section-description">Nestled in the lap of the gigantic Himalayan Range, tiny land-locked Nepal
                has eight out of ten highest
                mountains in the world, including Mt. Everest – the tallest in the world. Renowned for its abundance of
                natural beauty; bio-diversity; ethnic, linguistic, and social diversity; and historical and cultural
                wealth, the tourist arrivals have grown from just over 6,000 in 1962 to over a million today.</p>

            <p class="section-description">However, in fact, although occupying just 0.1% of the earth's surface, Nepal
                is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of bio-diversity due to its unique geographical
                position and altitudinal variation. The elevation of the country ranges from less than 100 metres above
                sea level in the Terai, to the highest point on earth, the summit of Mt. Everest, at 8,848 metres, all
                within a distance of about 150km, resulting in climatic conditions ranging from sub-tropical to Arctic.

                Nepal is topographically divided into three regions:
                The Himalaya to the north, the middle hills consisting of the Mahabharat
                range and the Churia Hills, and the Terai to the south.

                northern border of the country and represent 16% of the total land area. This is the least inhabited
                region of Nepal, with less than 8% of the population living there. Most permanent settlements are at
                less than 4000m altitude, although there are summer settlements as high as 5000m.</p>

                around 45% of the population of the country. This area is the home of the ancient ethnic people of
                Nepal. The climate is very good and most of Nepal�s lakes and beautiful valleys are located in the
                middle hills. Areas in the eastern hills receive most rainfall because of the monsoon clouds, which come
                from the Bay of Bengal. The middle hills provide a very good habitat for wild life, such as leopard,
                deer, bear, monkeys, butterflies and over four hundred indigenous species of birds.</p>

            <p class="section-description">The Terai is the southern part of Nepal and is an extension of the Gangetic
                plains of India. It covers 17% of the total land area, providing excellent farming land as well as space
                for large industrial areas. Until 1950, the Terai was predominantly an area of heavily malarial
                sub-tropical forest, inhabited only by the Royal Bengal tiger, leopard, wild boar, several species of
                deer, one-horned rhino, wild elephant and gharial and mugger crocodiles. But after the eradication of
                malaria in the 1960s, many people from the middle hills migrated to the Terai in search of farming land.
                Today, about 48% of the population occupies this region.</p>

                city Kathmandu enjoys a rich tapestry of cultures blending to form a national identity. Kathmandu Valley
                has served as the country’s cultural metropolis since the unification of Nepal in the 18th Century. A
                prominent factor in a Nepali’s everyday life is religion. Adding color to the lives of Nepalis are
                festivals the year round which they celebrate with much pomp and ceremony. Food plays an important role
                in the celebration of these festivals.</p>

            <p class="section-description">It is quite known among foreign tourists that Nepali cuisine offers a variety
                of seasonal as well as ethnic food varieties with a touch of warmth and hospitality. People of different
                ethnic races and different geographical locations have their own authentic food items. As a matter of
                fact, the unique food varieties found in Nepal reveals the wide variety of culture and traditions
                prevalent in Nepal. A first-time traveler in Nepal may feel that the country lacks food varieties other
                than the staple Dal-Bhaat-Tarkari. But, the fact is most of the authentic ethnic cuisines are not so
                common among the top restaurants and eateries. Most of the true ethnic food items are cooked and served
                only at special places. Due to this very reason, most of the distinctive Nepali dishes are left
                overlooked.
